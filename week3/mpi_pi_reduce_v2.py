# DESCRIPTION:
#   MPI pi Calculation Example - Python mpi4py version.
#   Collective Communication example:
#   This program calculates pi using a "dartboard" algorithm.  See
#   Fox et al.(1988) Solving Problems on Concurrent Processors, vol.1
#   page 207.  All processes contribute to the calculation, with the
#   master averaging the values for pi. This version uses mpi_reduce to
#   collect results

    Throw darts at board.  Done by generating random numbers
    between 0 and 1 and converting them to values for x and y
    coordinates and then testing to see if they "land" in
    the circle."  If so, score is incremented.  After throwing the
    specified number of darts, pi is calculated.  The computed value
    of pi is returned as the value of this function, dboard.
